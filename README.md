# AVA_SPF
The name AVA_SPF stands for Algorithms-Visualization-App-Sorting-and-PathFinding

This project is a merge of two of my previos projects PathFinderVisualizer and SortingAlgorithmVisualizer

I've added tha main script file for easy choosing of the preferred method of visualitzation.

The window that pops up when you run the main file will not close upon opening a visualizer so you should be able to close it and open another.

I kept the trend of the previous two projects to work with pygame.
